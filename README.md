# Othello
My Game, which I made for my school project

open UI.py to initialise the game itself. It may take a few minutes in the beginning to open as it will reroute all the images needed for the game.

Don't take a dig at it. This was done after 6 months of programming knowledge only knowing beginner stuff(way beyond what my peers could do at that time).No OOP, no fancy tricks. Just plain(not simple) python code.
This will probably come to haunt me when I will look back at it.
